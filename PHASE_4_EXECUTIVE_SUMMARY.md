# Phase 4 Executive Summary

**Date**: October 18, 2025  
**Review Source**: review41.md (Hyper-Critical Production Analysis)  
**Current Version**: v0.1.0a3 (Grade A - 94/100)

---

## üéØ The Bottom Line

**The original Phase 4 plan was too risky.** It mixed 4 different types of changes (refactor, tests, performance, new features) into one release, increasing the blast radius and risk of breaking production users.

**Solution**: Split Phase 4 into two releases with strict scope control.

---

## üì¶ New Two-Release Strategy

### Release 1: v0.1.0a4 (4-6 weeks)
**Focus**: Make the codebase maintainable WITHOUT breaking anything

**What's In**:
- ‚úÖ Refactor `__init__.py` (1,197 lines ‚Üí modular structure)
- ‚úÖ Risk-weighted tests (70% ‚Üí 80% coverage)
- ‚úÖ Performance benchmarking harness
- ‚úÖ Minimal UX polish (`--verbose` flag only)

**What's OUT**:
- ‚ùå No new analyzers
- ‚ùå No new config keys
- ‚ùå No CLI contract changes
- ‚ùå No interactive features

**Grade Target**: A (95-96/100)

### Release 2: v0.2.0 (2-4 weeks)
**Focus**: Add new capabilities now that foundation is solid

**What's In**:
- ‚úÖ Secrets detection analyzer (detect-secrets)
- ‚úÖ Config validation commands
- ‚úÖ Progress bars and interactive mode

**Grade Target**: A+ (97+/100)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Changes from Original Plan

| Original Plan Issue | Why It's Risky | New Approach |
|---------------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Scope mixing** | 4 change types in one phase | Split into 2 releases by type |
| **Underspecified refactor** | No git history plan, no backout | Detailed `git mv` plan + import shim |
| **Percentage-driven testing** | Chasing coverage %, not risk | Target specific risk areas first |
| **Soft performance goals** | No hardware profile or fixtures | Reproducible harness on CI hardware |
| **Vague UX goals** | "Interactive mode" not testable | Strict acceptance criteria |
| **Secrets analyzer underestimated** | Complex feature, many decisions | Narrow MVP with locked decisions |

---

## üîê Key Safety Mechanisms

### 1. Refactor Safety Plan

**Problem**: Moving 1,197 lines of code could break everything.

**Solution**:
```bash
# Use git mv to preserve history
git mv src/specify_cli/__init__.py src/specify_cli/_monolith.py
# Then progressively split into modules

# Create import shim for backward compatibility
# src/specify_cli/compat.py
from specify_cli.ui.banner import show_banner
__all__ = ["show_banner"]

# Backout plan: Single revert commit
git revert <refactor-pr-sha>
```

### 2. Risk-Weighted Testing

**Problem**: Chasing 80% coverage without targeting real risks.

**Solution**: Test these specific modules first (they can break users):
- `baseline.py` - Regex suppression, fingerprint stability
- `config.py` - Precedence tree, validation
- `runner.py` - Error propagation
- `gitutils.py` - Changed-only logic
- `store.py` - JSON recovery

### 3. Performance Benchmarking

**Problem**: "Make it faster" is not measurable.

**Solution**: Locked targets on CI hardware (ubuntu-latest, 2vCPU, 7GB RAM):

| Analyzer | Dataset | Target |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Bandit | 1k LOC | < 3s |
| Bandit | 10k LOC | < 15s |
| Bandit | 100k LOC | < 90s |
| Safety | 20 deps | < 2s |
| Safety | 100 deps | < 10s |
| Safety | 500 deps | < 60s |

If targets miss ‚Üí Fail CI, block merge.

### 4. Secrets Analyzer Security

**Problem**: Could leak sensitive data in outputs.

**Solution**: 
- Redact all matches (show type + hash prefix only)
- End-to-end test: Scan file with known secret, assert literal NOT in any output
- Fail closed: Missing CLI in `--strict` mode ‚Üí exit code 2

---

## üìã PR Sequencing (Small Blast Radius)

### v0.1.0a4 (7 Small PRs)

1. **PR-1**: Move `ui.banner` (3-5 files)
2. **PR-2**: Move `github.download` + `extraction` (4-6 files)
3. **PR-3**: Move `vscode.settings` (2-3 files)
4. **PR-4**: Move `commands.init` + `check` (4-6 files)
5. **PR-5**: Add risk-weighted tests (7 test files)
6. **PR-6**: Performance harness + CI job (5-7 files)
7. **PR-7**: Verbose mode + summary (3-4 files)

**Why small PRs?**
- Easier to review
- Faster to merge
- Smaller rollback if something breaks

### v0.2.0 (4 PRs)

1. **PR-A**: Secrets analyzer skeleton (3-5 files)
2. **PR-B**: SARIF mapping + redaction (4-6 files)
3. **PR-C**: Config commands (3-4 files)
4. **PR-D**: Progress + interactive mode (3-5 files)

## üí° Key Insights from Review

### 1. Refactors Are Migrations
"There is no proof that git history will be preserved, no import map, no backout plan."

**Lesson**: Treat refactors like database migrations. Have a rollback plan.

### 2. Test Risk, Not Percentage
"Coverage goal is fine, but you did not tie tests to concrete risk areas."

**Lesson**: 80% coverage on low-risk code < 50% coverage on high-risk modules.

### 3. Performance Without Harness = Noise
"Targets lack hardware profile, dataset fixtures, and reproducible harness."

**Lesson**: "Made it faster" is meaningless without reproducible benchmarks.

### 4. Scope Creep Kills Phases
"Scope mixing increases blast radius and stretches review capacity."

**Lesson**: Split releases by type of change, not by arbitrary timeline.

### 5. Features Are Icebergs
"Secrets analyzer choice of engine, redaction policy, allow list model are nontrivial."

**Lesson**: MVP a complex feature or it will dominate the phase.
