Here is a no-nonsense gap list for turning your MVP into a real, repeatable analysis product. I grouped it by area, gave the why, exactly what to add, and how to verify it. I also added concrete file names, flags, and snippets so you can drop these into forms, tickets, and your README.

# Product and architecture gaps

1. Configuration file and policy system

* Why: You need deterministic runs and team control over paths, severities, and suppressions.
* Add: `.speckit.toml` with sections for includes, excludes, severities, tool backends, and thresholds.
* Files and flags:

  * New: `src/specify_cli/config.py`
  * New: `.speckit.toml`
  * CLI: `--config`, `--severity-threshold`, `--fail-on N`
* Sample:

  ```toml
  [scan]
  includes = ["src/**.py"]
  excludes = ["**/migrations/**", "tests/**"]
  changed_only = true

  [security]
  severity_threshold = "MEDIUM"
  allow = []  # list of rule ids to allow
  deny = ["B602","B603"]  # curl subprocess example

  [dependencies]
  manager = "pip"  # pip or poetry
  fail_on = "HIGH"

  [quality]
  complexity_threshold = 10

  [report]
  formats = ["markdown","json","sarif"]
  out_dir = ".speckit/analysis"
  ```

2. Plugin interface for analyzers

* Why: You will add more languages and tools. Keep analyzers decoupled.
* Add: Abstract base `Analyzer` with register function and entry points.
* Files: `src/specify_cli/analyzers/base.py` with `analyze()`, `name`, `capabilities`, `to_dicts()`.

3. Results storage and schema

* Why: You need history, deduping, and delta reports.
* Add: SQLite store under `.speckit/db.sqlite` with tables `runs`, `findings`, `artifacts`.
* Files: `src/specify_cli/store.py`
* Verify: `specify audit --store` then `specify report --since last` prints only new or regressed findings.

4. Baseline and suppressions

* Why: Teams must adopt without failing CI on legacy debt.
* Add: `.speckit/baseline.json` produced by `specify baseline create`. Support inline suppression comments.
* Inline examples:

  * Python: `# speckit: ignore=B101 reason=demo`
* CLI: `specify baseline create`, `specify baseline apply`, `--respect-inline-suppressions`.

5. Exit codes and failure policy

* Why: CI needs a simple pass or fail gate.
* Add: `--fail-on-severity`, `--max-findings`, `--changed-only`.
* Verify: A PR with one HIGH finding causes exit 1.

# Analysis coverage gaps

6. Dependency scanning choices and SBOM

* Why: Safety is fine, but add pip-audit option and SBOM for supply chain.
* Add: selectable engine `safety` or `pip-audit`; generate CycloneDX JSON.
* Files: `src/specify_cli/analyzers/deps.py`
* CLI: `specify sbom --format cyclonedx --output .speckit/analysis/sbom.json`.

7. Secrets detection

* Why: Hardcoded secrets are high value.
* Add: wrapper for `detect-secrets` or `trufflehog` with JSON normalization.
* Files: `src/specify_cli/analyzers/secrets.py`
* Config: allowlist patterns, entropy thresholds.

8. Code quality depth

* Why: MVP only surfaces complexity. Add maintainability, duplication, and long functions.
* Add: radon MI, duplicate detection with `jscpd` like logic for Python only to start.
* Output: mark functions over 50 lines and nesting over 4 levels.

9. Custom AST rules and taint hints

* Why: Your differentiator is domain rules.
* Add: more Python AST rules: mutable default args, SQL string concatenation, input validation gaps.
* Provide a tiny taint model config: sources, sinks, sanitizers in `.speckit.toml`.

10. Multilanguage roadmap stubs

* Why: Show path to Node and shell.
* Add stubs with graceful opt in:

  * Node: npm audit JSON normalization, eslint security plugin hook.
  * Shell: basic grep rules for `curl | sh` and unsafe flags.
* Guard with config so runs are deterministic even if tools are missing.

# Reporting and integrations gaps

11. SARIF output for GitHub code scanning

* Why: Native PR annotations and security dashboard.
* Add: SARIF writer and upload example.
* Files: `src/specify_cli/reporters/sarif.py`
* GitHub Action step:

  ```yaml
  - run: specify audit --output sarif --path .
  - uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
    with:
      sarif_file: .speckit/analysis/report.sarif
  ```

12. HTML single file report

* Why: Shareable artifact for PMs and auditors.
* Add: Jinja2 template with summary, filtering, and collapsible details.
* Files: `src/specify_cli/reporters/html.py`, `templates/report.html`.

13. Triage workflow and status

* Why: Manage false positives.
* Add: triage commands to set `status = open, acknowledged, false_positive, fixed`.
* CLI: `specify triage set --id F123 --status false_positive --reason "validated"`.

14. CWE and CVSS normalization

* Why: Consistent severity mapping.
* Add: map Bandit and Safety outputs to CWE id and CVSS score field where available, default to your own severity ladder.
* File: `src/specify_cli/severity.py`.

# Workflow and DevEx gaps

15. Speed, parallelism, and incremental scans

* Why: 10k LOC under 30 seconds target.
* Add: multiprocessing pool, file hashing cache, and `--changed-only` using `git diff`.
* Files: `src/specify_cli/runner.py`, `src/specify_cli/gitutils.py`.
* Config: `max_workers`, `warm_cache = true`.

16. Pre-commit and staged scans

* Why: Fast feedback loops.
* Add a pre-commit hook that runs `specify audit --changed-only`.
* Snippet:

  ```yaml
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: speckit-audit
        name: speckit-audit
        entry: specify audit --changed-only --output markdown
        language: system
        pass_filenames: false
  ```

17. IDE glue

* Why: Make it easy to adopt.
* Add VS Code tasks to run audit and open the HTML report.
* `.vscode/tasks.json` with a `specify audit` task.

18. Error messages and doctor command

* Why: Remove confusion when tools are missing.
* Add: `specify doctor` that checks Python, bandit, radon, safety, npm, and prints install commands.

19. Logs and structured output

* Why: Debugging and analytics.
* Add: `--verbose` for human output and `--log-json` for machine logs.
* File: `src/specify_cli/logging.py`.

# Security, privacy, compliance gaps

20. Safe execution model

* Why: Scanning untrusted repos can be risky.
* Add: sandbox note and advice for path traversal, and restrict external calls. No network during analysis unless user sets `--net`.
* Document this in README.

21. Compliance mapping

* Why: You already operate in healthcare.
* Add: `docs/compliance_map.md` that ties findings to HIPAA, NIST 800-53, and SOC 2 concepts.
* Include a small export: `specify report --framework hipaa` that adds tags to findings.

22. Telemetry policy

* Why: Decide early.
* Add: default off telemetry with `SPECKIT_TELEMETRY=1` opt in. Collect anonymized counts only. Provide `specify telemetry explain` and `specify telemetry purge`.

# Testing and quality gaps

23. Golden tests and regression packs

* Why: Maintain determinism.
* Add: pinned fixtures for known vulnerable repos and expected finding counts.
* Command: `pytest -m golden`.
* Targets: small subsets of OWASP samples with licenses noted.

24. Fuzz and property tests on parsers

* Why: Hardening.
* Add: Hypothesis based tests for config and report writers.

25. Cross platform CI matrix

* Why: Real users use Windows and Linux too.
* Add: ubuntu, macos, windows job matrix. Cache pip. Enforce `python 3.11 and 3.12`.

# Distribution and release gaps

26. Versioning and changelog

* Why: Trust and reproducibility.
* Add: Semver, `CHANGELOG.md`, Release GitHub Action that builds wheel and sdist.

27. Packaging and install paths

* Why: One line install story.
* Add: publish to PyPI. Also provide `uv tool install specify-cli` instructions. Keep your internal org tap optional.

28. Licensing and third party notices

* Why: Legal hygiene.
* Add: `LICENSE`, `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`. State how you invoke bandit, safety, radon.

# Documentation and onboarding gaps

29. User guide and quickstarts

* Files:

  * `docs/quickstart.md`
  * `docs/configuration.md`
  * `docs/ci_examples.md`
  * `docs/triage.md`
* Include real copy-paste blocks and final file paths.

30. Positioning and scope

* Add: honest claims in README and a clear MVP table of supported features vs future roadmap.

## Acceptance tests to define now

Create these as high level checks in `tests/acceptance`:

* `test_exit_code_thresholds.py`

  * Arrange: one HIGH security finding
  * Assert: `specify audit --fail-on-severity HIGH` exits 1

* `test_baseline_respected.py`

  * Arrange: baseline contains existing HIGH finding
  * Assert: audit exits 0 with `--respect-baseline`

* `test_sarif_emission.py`

  * Assert: `.speckit/analysis/report.sarif` exists and validates against schema

* `test_changed_only_git.py`

  * Arrange: create a file after a git commit
  * Assert: only the changed file is scanned with `--changed-only`

* `test_config_excludes.py`

  * Assert: excluded path is not scanned

---

## README updates you should add now

* New section: Configuration with `.speckit.toml` example.
* New section: CI integration with SARIF upload example.
* New section: Baseline and suppressions with exact comments.
* New section: Exit codes and thresholds.
* New section: Security model and no network default.
* Table: Supported analyzers with flags and optional dependencies.
* Command index with one line purpose per command.

---

## Names and values for forms and fields

* Package name: `specify-cli`
* CLI command: `specify`
* Config file: `.speckit.toml`
* Default output directory: `.speckit/analysis`
* Database file: `.speckit/db.sqlite`
* Baseline file: `.speckit/baseline.json`

---

## Next step suggestions

Short, high leverage sequence you can implement immediately:

1. Add config loader and flags

* Build `src/specify_cli/config.py` and wire `--config` to CLI.

2. Add SARIF reporter and CI upload step

* This gives PR annotations and makes the tool feel real.

3. Add baseline create and apply

* Low cost, high adoption impact.

4. Add exit code thresholds

* Unblocks enforcement in CI.

5. Add detect-secrets wrapper

* Instantly increases perceived and real value.

6. Add HTML report

* Improves collaboration between engineers and PMs.

## Manager's note for your hardcopy

Title: Spec Kit Pro gap analysis and prioritized backlog on Oct 18, 2025
Scope: Identified 30 concrete gaps across config, plugins, storage, reporting, CI integrations, secrets, SBOM, performance, triage, and docs.
Decision: Implement config, SARIF, baseline, exit codes, and secrets scanning in the next sprint to achieve CI-grade MVP.

---

## Running log of actions

* Compiled a detailed gap list mapped to file names, flags, and acceptance tests.
* Provided ready to paste config, SARIF, pre-commit, and triage snippets.
* Produced a prioritized next step plan and README deltas.

If you want, I can generate the `.speckit.toml`, SARIF writer, and baseline commands in code blocks you can paste directly into your repo next.
