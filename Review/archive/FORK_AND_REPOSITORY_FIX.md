# How to Properly Set Up Your Forked/Modified Spec-Kit

**Date:** October 18, 2025

## üî¥ **CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED**

Your repository is currently pointing to the **official GitHub spec-kit** repo:
```
origin: https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git
```

**This is WRONG for your use case because:**

1. ‚ùå You can't push your changes to GitHub's official repo (you don't have permission)
2. ‚ùå Your "rehabilitation" features will never be accepted upstream (they're experimental)
3. ‚ùå You're on a branch called "main" that tracks GitHub's official project
4. ‚ùå Other developers would clone GitHub's repo, not your modified version
5. ‚ùå The repo name "EventDeskPro" doesn't match the content "spec-kit"

---

## üéØ **WHAT YOU NEED TO DECIDE**

### **Option 1: Create Your Own Fork (Recommended)**
*Best if you want to build on spec-kit and add your own features*

### **Option 2: Create Standalone Project**
*Best if you want complete independence from spec-kit*

### **Option 3: Contribute Upstream**
*Best if you want your changes in the official spec-kit*

---

## ‚úÖ **OPTION 1: Create Your Own Fork** (RECOMMENDED)

This is what you should do if you want to:
- Build on top of spec-kit
- Add your rehabilitation features
- Use it across multiple projects
- Eventually share with others

### **Step 1: Create Your Own GitHub Repository**

```bash
# Go to GitHub.com and create a NEW repository
# Name it something meaningful:
# - "spec-kit-enhanced" 
# - "spec-kit-rehabilitation"
# - "spec-analyzer" (if you build the real tools)
# 
# Do NOT initialize with README (you already have files)
```

### **Step 2: Update Git Remote**

```bash
cd /Users/VScode_Projects/projects/Spec-Kit-Rehabilitation/spec-kit

# Rename current remote from 'origin' to 'upstream'
git remote rename origin upstream

# Add YOUR new repository as 'origin'
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_NEW_REPO_NAME.git

# Verify configuration
git remote -v

# Should show:
# origin    https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_NEW_REPO_NAME.git (fetch)
# origin    https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_NEW_REPO_NAME.git (push)
# upstream  https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git (fetch)
# upstream  https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git (push)
```

### **Step 3: Commit Your Changes**

```bash
# Stage all your new files
git add .

# Commit with clear message
git commit -m "Add rehabilitation features and analysis tools

- Added real security scanning (Bandit integration)
- Created roadmap for legitimate tool development
- Added honest assessment documentation
- Included quick start implementation guide
- Enhanced with security analysis templates"

# Push to YOUR repository
git push -u origin main
```

### **Step 4: Update README**

Add this section to the top of your README:

```markdown
# Spec-Kit Enhanced (or your chosen name)

**A fork of [GitHub Spec-Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) with enhanced project rehabilitation features.**

## What's Different?

This fork extends the official Spec-Kit with:
- **Real security analysis** (Bandit, Safety integration)
- **Code quality metrics** (Radon, complexity analysis)
- **Project rehabilitation tools** (reverse engineering, auditing)
- **AI-enhanced workflows** (combines static analysis + AI review)

## Upstream Relationship

This project is based on GitHub's Spec-Kit but adds significant enhancements.
We periodically sync with upstream to get bug fixes and improvements.

To sync with upstream:
\`\`\`bash
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
\`\`\`

## Original Spec-Kit

For the official, minimal Spec-Kit, see: https://github.com/github/spec-kit
```

### **Step 5: Add Fork Attribution**

Create a `ATTRIBUTION.md` file:

```markdown
# Attribution

This project is a fork of [GitHub Spec-Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit).

## Original Authors
- GitHub, Inc. and contributors
- Original repository: https://github.com/github/spec-kit
- License: MIT (see LICENSE file)

## Enhancements
Additional features and modifications by [Your Name/Team].

## License Compliance
This fork maintains the original MIT license and complies with all
attribution requirements.
```

### **Step 6: Update pyproject.toml**

```toml
[project]
name = "spec-kit-enhanced"  # or your chosen name
version = "0.1.0"  # Start fresh with your versioning
description = "Enhanced Spec-Kit with real code analysis and project rehabilitation tools"
# ... rest of config
```

---

## ‚úÖ **OPTION 2: Create Standalone Project**

Choose this if you want **complete independence** from spec-kit.

### **Step 1: Extract Only What You Need**

```bash
# Create new project directory
mkdir -p ~/Projects/my-code-analyzer
cd ~/Projects/my-code-analyzer

# Copy only YOUR files (not upstream spec-kit)
cp -r /Users/VScode_Projects/projects/Spec-Kit-Rehabilitation/spec-kit/src .
cp /Users/VScode_Projects/projects/Spec-Kit-Rehabilitation/spec-kit/pyproject.toml .
cp /Users/VScode_Projects/projects/Spec-Kit-Rehabilitation/spec-kit/tests .
cp /Users/VScode_Projects/projects/Spec-Kit-Rehabilitation/spec-kit/ROADMAP_TO_LEGITIMACY.md .
cp /Users/VScode_Projects/projects/Spec-Kit-Rehabilitation/spec-kit/QUICK_START_IMPLEMENTATION.md .

# Initialize NEW git repository
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Code analyzer tool"

# Create GitHub repo and push
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/code-analyzer.git
git push -u origin main
```

### **Step 2: Remove Spec-Kit Branding**

- Rename CLI from `specify` to something else (e.g., `codeaudit`)
- Remove spec-kit specific features you don't need
- Write your own README from scratch
- Create your own identity

### **Step 3: Credit Original Inspiration**

In your README:

```markdown
## Inspiration

This project was inspired by [GitHub Spec-Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit)
but has been completely rewritten to focus on code analysis and security scanning.
```

---

## ‚úÖ **OPTION 3: Contribute Upstream**

Choose this if you want your features in the **official spec-kit**.

**‚ö†Ô∏è BUT FIRST:** The official spec-kit maintainers might NOT want:
- Experimental rehabilitation features
- Heavy dependencies (Bandit, Safety, etc.)
- Features that increase complexity

### **Before Investing Time:**

1. **Open a GitHub Discussion:**
   ```
   Title: "Proposal: Add Project Rehabilitation Features"
   
   Hey team, I've built some enhancements to spec-kit that add:
   - Real security scanning (Bandit integration)
   - Code analysis tools
   - Project rehabilitation workflows
   
   Would this be in scope for the official project?
   If so, I can clean it up and submit a PR.
   ```

2. **Wait for Response:**
   - If YES ‚Üí Clean up code, submit PR
   - If NO ‚Üí Go with Option 1 (fork) instead

## üîß **FIXING THE NESTED DIRECTORY STRUCTURE**

Regardless of which option you choose, fix this:

```bash
# Current structure (WRONG):
# EventDeskPro/Spec-Kit-Rehabilitation/spec-kit/

# Move everything up to proper location
cd /Users/VScode_Projects/projects/
mv Spec-Kit-Rehabilitation/spec-kit spec-kit-enhanced  # or your chosen name
rm -rf Spec-Kit-Rehabilitation  # Remove empty wrapper

# Now you have:
# spec-kit-enhanced/
# ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .git/
# ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
# ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/
# ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

---

## üìã **RECOMMENDED ACTION PLAN**

### **For Your Situation, I Recommend Option 1 (Fork):**

**Why?**
- You want to use this across multiple projects
- You're building real enhancements
- You want to potentially share with others
- You might want to sync bug fixes from upstream

**Steps This Weekend:**

```bash
# 1. Create GitHub repo (on GitHub.com)
#    Name: "spec-kit-enhanced" or "spec-analyzer"

# 2. Update git remotes
cd /Users/VScode_Projects/projects/Spec-Kit-Rehabilitation/spec-kit
git remote rename origin upstream
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/spec-kit-enhanced.git

# 3. Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add rehabilitation and analysis features"
git push -u origin main

# 4. Fix directory structure
cd /Users/VScode_Projects/projects/
mv Spec-Kit-Rehabilitation/spec-kit spec-kit-enhanced
rm -rf Spec-Kit-Rehabilitation

# 5. Update README with fork attribution
# (see example above)
```

---

## üéØ **AFTER FIXING THE REPOSITORY**

Once you have your own repo set up properly:

### **Syncing with Upstream (Optional)**

If you want bug fixes from official spec-kit:

```bash
# Fetch updates from official spec-kit
git fetch upstream

# Merge their changes into your branch
git merge upstream/main

# Resolve any conflicts
# Then push to your repo
git push origin main
```

### **Working on Features**

```bash
# Create feature branches
git checkout -b add-security-scanning
# ... make changes ...
git commit -m "Implement Bandit security scanner"
git push origin add-security-scanning

# Merge to main when ready
git checkout main
git merge add-security-scanning
git push origin main
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **LEGAL/LICENSE CONSIDERATIONS**

### **If You Fork (Option 1):**

‚úÖ **You MUST:**
- Keep original MIT license
- Credit original authors
- Include attribution

‚úÖ **You CAN:**
- Add your own features
- Use any name you want
- Charge for services/support (but code stays MIT)

‚ùå **You CANNOT:**
- Remove GitHub's copyright
- Claim you created the original
- Change the license without permission

### **If You Go Standalone (Option 2):**

If you use ANY code from spec-kit:
- ‚úÖ Still must credit in ATTRIBUTION.md
- ‚úÖ Still must keep MIT license on borrowed code
- ‚úÖ Can add new code under different license

If you write EVERYTHING from scratch:
- ‚úÖ Can use any license
- ‚úÖ No attribution needed (but nice to credit inspiration)
