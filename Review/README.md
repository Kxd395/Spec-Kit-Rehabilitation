## 🎯 Current Status

**Current Build:** v0.1.0a3 (Phase 2.5)  
**Current Grade:** A (92/100)  
**Working Features:**
- ✅ Bandit security scanning
- ✅ SARIF 2.1.0 output (GitHub Code Scanning)
- ✅ HTML, JSON, Markdown reports
- ✅ Baseline filtering for incremental adoption
- ✅ Doctor command for environment validation
- ✅ Modular command structure
- ✅ Git integration for changed-only scans
- ✅ Exit code policies (fail-on HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- ✅ GitHub Actions CI with SARIF upload

**Known Issues:**
- Python 3.14 compatibility (Bandit AST errors)
- No dependency scanning yet (Safety/pip-audit)
- No secrets detection yet
- Limited test coverage (3 integration tests)

## 📅 Next Steps - Phase 3

**Target Grade:** A+ (96/100)  
**Estimated Time:** 16 hours (~2 weekend days)

### Priority 1 - MVP Completion (12h)
1. Safety/pip-audit integration (4h)
2. Secrets detection (4h)
3. Baseline CLI commands (2h)
4. Config loader (.speckit.toml) (2h)

### Priority 2 - Quality (4h)
5. Unit tests (test_baseline.py, test_exit_codes.py, test_sarif.py)
6. CI matrix (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows × Python 3.11, 3.12)

### Phase 3 Deliverables
- Multi-analyzer support (Bandit + Safety + Secrets)
- Complete baseline workflow (create/apply commands)
- Config file support (.speckit.toml)
- 70% test coverage
- Cross-platform CI

## 📊 Grade Progression

```
Phase 1: B+ (82/100) - Infrastructure only
Phase 2: A- (88/100) - Working scanner
Phase 2.5: A (92/100) - Production ready
Phase 3: A+ (96/100) - Full MVP (target)
```

## 🎓 Key Learnings

1. **Infrastructure first pays off** - Phase 1 made Phase 2 trivial
2. **Modular architecture is essential** - Phase 2.5 refactor enables Phase 3
3. **Baseline support is critical** - Teams can adopt incrementally
4. **HTML reports are valuable** - Non-engineers can understand findings
5. **Doctor command saves time** - Environment validation upfront
