  - REST â†’ GraphQL (if beneficial)
  - CSS â†’ Tailwind/CSS Modules

- **Backend:**
  - Monolith â†’ Microservices (if scale requires)
  - Blocking I/O â†’ Async/await
  - Manual queries â†’ ORM
  - Sessions â†’ JWT tokens

- **Database:**
  - Add indexes for performance
  - Implement caching layer (Redis)
  - Consider read replicas
  - Add database migrations

- **Infrastructure:**
  - Manual deployment â†’ CI/CD
  - Single server â†’ Load balanced
  - No monitoring â†’ APM + logging
  - No backups â†’ Automated backups

### 4. Enhance Specifications

**Update each feature spec to include:**

- **Security Requirements:**
  - Input validation rules
  - Authentication/authorization
  - Data encryption
  - Rate limiting

- **Performance Requirements:**
  - Response time targets
  - Throughput requirements
  - Scalability goals
  - Resource limits

- **Quality Requirements:**
  - Test coverage expectations
  - Code quality standards
  - Documentation requirements
  - Error handling approach

- **Accessibility Requirements:**
  - WCAG compliance level
  - Keyboard navigation
  - Screen reader support
  - Color contrast ratios

- **Monitoring Requirements:**
  - Key metrics to track
  - Alerting thresholds
  - Logging requirements
  - Error tracking

### 5. Create Migration Plan

**Document transition strategy:**

- **Incremental approach** (preferred)
  - Feature-by-feature migration
  - Strangler fig pattern
  - Feature flags
  - Gradual rollout

- **Big bang approach** (when necessary)
  - Complete rewrite
  - Parallel run period
  - Cutover plan
  - Rollback strategy
