### Changed

- Enhanced Spec-Kit from greenfield-only to supporting both:
  - ðŸ†• **New projects** (existing workflow)
  - ðŸ”„ **Existing projects** (new rehabilitation workflow)

### Use Cases Enabled

- âœ… Legacy application modernization
- âœ… Security hardening of existing codebases
- âœ… Documentation recovery for undocumented projects
- âœ… Architecture refactoring with minimal risk
- âœ… Technology migration (e.g., PHP â†’ Node.js)
- âœ… Team onboarding acceleration
- âœ… Compliance remediation (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)

### Benefits

**For Security Teams:**
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Systematic remediation planning
- Compliance validation

**For Architecture Teams:**
- Reverse engineering capabilities
- Architecture documentation generation
- Modernization recommendations

**For Development Teams:**
- Spec generation from code
- Safe, incremental migration
- Automated testing

**For Product Teams:**
- Feature inventory from existing code
- Risk assessment and mitigation
- Stakeholder communication templates

### Technical Details

**Files Added:**
- `templates/commands/reverse-engineer.md`
- `templates/commands/audit.md`
- `templates/commands/upgrade.md`
- `templates/commands/migrate.md`
- `templates/commands/compare.md`
- `PROJECT-REHABILITATION.md`
- `REHABILITATION-ENHANCEMENT-SUMMARY.md`

**Files Modified:**
- `README.md` - Added rehabilitation section

**No Breaking Changes:**
- All existing Spec-Kit workflows remain unchanged
- New commands are additive only
- Backward compatible with existing projects

### Migration Guide

**For Existing Spec-Kit Users:**

No migration needed! Your existing workflows continue to work exactly as before.

**To Use New Rehabilitation Features:**

```bash
# Navigate to an existing project
cd /path/to/existing-project

# Initialize Spec-Kit
specify init . --here --ai copilot

# Start rehabilitation workflow
/speckit.reverse-engineer
/speckit.audit
/speckit.upgrade
/speckit.plan
/speckit.compare
/speckit.migrate
/speckit.implement
```

### Future Enhancements (Potential)

- [ ] CLI integration: `specify analyze` command
- [ ] Python dependencies for enhanced analysis
- [ ] Language-specific analyzers (Python, JavaScript, Java, etc.)
- [ ] Integration with security scanning tools (Snyk, SonarQube)
- [ ] Automated test generation from existing code
- [ ] Performance benchmarking tools
- [ ] AI-powered code smell detection
- [ ] Dependency upgrade automation

### Contributors

- Enhanced by: Spec-Kit Community
- Inspired by: Real-world needs for legacy modernization
- Philosophy: Make code rehabilitation systematic and safe

---

## Summary

This release transforms Spec-Kit from a greenfield-only tool into a comprehensive project transformation platform, enabling teams to systematically rehabilitate legacy codebases with the same rigor and documentation as new projects.

**The rehabilitation workflow provides a structured, AI-guided approach to:**
- Understanding existing systems
- Identifying problems
- Creating better specifications
- Safely migrating to improved implementations

**Impact:** Enables thousands of teams to tackle technical debt and legacy modernization with confidence.
