## What is Project Rehabilitation?

**Project Rehabilitation** is the process of taking an existing codebase with problems (poor design, security issues, lack of documentation, technical debt) and systematically transforming it into a well-architected, secure, and maintainable application using Spec-Kit's Spec-Driven Development approach.

### The Problem

Many projects suffer from:

- ❌ **Poor architecture** - Tightly coupled, hard to maintain
- ❌ **Security vulnerabilities** - Known CVEs, insecure patterns
- ❌ **Lack of documentation** - No specs, tribal knowledge only
- ❌ **Technical debt** - Quick fixes accumulated over time
- ❌ **No tests** - Fear of making changes
- ❌ **Outdated dependencies** - Using EOL frameworks

### The Solution

Spec-Kit Rehabilitation provides:

- ✅ **Reverse engineering** - Generate specs FROM existing code
- ✅ **Automated audits** - Identify security and quality issues
- ✅ **Spec upgrades** - Modern, best-practice specifications
- ✅ **Migration planning** - Safe, incremental transformation
- ✅ **Comparison tools** - Verify feature parity

---

## When to Use This

### ✅ Good Use Cases

- **Legacy modernization** - Upgrade old applications
- **Security hardening** - Fix vulnerabilities systematically
- **Documentation recovery** - Create specs for undocumented projects
- **Architecture refactoring** - Improve design with minimal risk
- **Technology migration** - Move to modern frameworks
- **Onboarding acceleration** - Help new devs understand the project

### ❌ Not Ideal For

- Brand new projects (use standard Spec-Kit workflow instead)
- Projects that are working perfectly and don't need changes
- Throwaway prototypes
- Projects you plan to completely rewrite from scratch anyway

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Analyze the Existing Project

**Navigate to your existing project:**

```bash
cd /path/to/your/messy-project
```

**Initialize Spec-Kit (if not already):**

```bash
specify init . --here --ai copilot
```

**Generate specifications from existing code:**

```bash
/speckit.reverse-engineer
```

This will:

- Scan your entire codebase
- Identify features and functionality
- Extract data models and APIs
- Create initial specification documents
- Generate a project analysis report

**Output:**

```
.speckit/
├── constitution.md          # Extracted coding principles
└── analysis-report.md       # Detailed project analysis

specs/
├── 001-authentication/
│   ├── spec.md             # Feature specification
│   └── current-impl.md     # How it's currently built
├── 002-user-management/
│   └── ...
└── current-architecture.md  # Overall architecture
```

### Step 2: Audit for Issues

**Run comprehensive audit:**

```bash
/speckit.audit
```

This will:

- Scan for security vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
- Check dependencies for known CVEs
- Analyze code quality and complexity
- Review architecture for anti-patterns
- Evaluate performance bottlenecks
- Check compliance (GDPR, WCAG, etc.)

**Output:**

```
.speckit/
└── audit-report.md         # Comprehensive audit findings
```

**Review the report:**

- 🔴 **Critical issues** - Fix immediately
- 🟠 **High priority** - Address soon
- 🟡 **Medium priority** - Plan for next quarter
- 🟢 **Low priority** - Nice to have

### Step 3: Upgrade Specifications

**Generate improved specifications:**

```bash
/speckit.upgrade
```

This will:

- Incorporate audit findings
- Add security requirements
- Modernize tech stack choices
- Apply architectural best practices
- Include performance targets
- Add accessibility requirements

**Output:**

```
specs/
├── upgraded/
│   ├── constitution.md
│   ├── 001-authentication/
│   │   ├── spec.md             # Improved spec
│   │   ├── improvements.md     # What changed
│   │   └── migration-plan.md   # How to migrate
│   └── ...
├── original/                   # Backup of original specs
└── upgrade-summary.md
```

### Step 4: Create Implementation Plan

**Generate technical plan for upgraded specs:**

```bash
/speckit.plan
```

This will:

- Define modern tech stack
- Design improved architecture
- Create data models
- Define API contracts
- Plan testing strategy

**Output:**

```
specs/upgraded/001-authentication/
├── plan.md
├── data-model.md
└── contracts/
    └── api.md
```

### Step 5: Compare Old vs New

**Verify feature parity and improvements:**

```bash
/speckit.compare
```

This will:

- Compare all features (old vs new)
- Verify no functionality is lost
- Measure performance improvements
- Document security enhancements
- Identify breaking changes

**Output:**

```
.speckit/
└── comparison-report.md
```

**Review the report:**

- Ensure all features are accounted for
- Verify improvements are worthwhile
- Check for breaking changes
- Validate migration complexity

### Step 6: Plan the Migration

**Create detailed migration strategy:**

```bash
/speckit.migrate
```

This will:

- Choose migration strategy (strangler fig, blue-green, etc.)
- Create phase-by-phase plan
- Define data migration scripts
- Plan deployment strategy
- Prepare rollback procedures

**Output:**

```
.speckit/
├── migration-plan.md
└── rollback-procedures.md
```

### Step 7: Implement the Upgraded Version

**Build the improved system:**

```bash
/speckit.tasks     # Generate task list
/speckit.implement # Execute implementation
```

**Migration approaches:**

#### Option A: Incremental (Recommended)

- Migrate one feature at a time
- Use feature flags to toggle between old/new
- Validate each feature before moving to next
- Minimal risk, continuous delivery

#### Option B: Blue-Green

- Build entire new system in parallel
- Switch traffic atomically
- Keep old system for rollback
- Higher risk, but faster overall

#### Option C: Strangler Fig

- New system wraps old system
- Gradually replace pieces
- Both systems running during transition
- Very low risk, longer timeline
