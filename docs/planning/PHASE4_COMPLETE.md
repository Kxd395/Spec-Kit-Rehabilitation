- Can be added in v1.1.0 or later

**Future Considerations**:
- Document bandit scan times for various codebase sizes
- Document safety check duration
- Create memory usage profiles
- Add performance.md guide
- Enable benchmark tests (currently skipped)

## Critical Success Factors

### ✅ Achieved

1. **100% Test Pass Rate** - All tests passing, zero failures
2. **CI/CD Infrastructure** - Automated testing and quality gates live
3. **PyPI Distribution Ready** - Complete metadata, validated, buildable
4. **Professional Documentation** - README with badges, features, clear structure

3. **Performance Benchmarking** - Optional, can be added in v1.1.0

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well

1. **Incremental Approach** - Breaking Phase 4 into 5 tasks allowed clear progress tracking
2. **CI/CD Early** - Implementing workflows early caught potential issues
3. **PyPI Validation** - Testing build/install process before publication prevented surprises
4. **Documentation First** - README modernization improved project perception immediately
5. **Quality Gates** - Pre-commit hooks and CI prevented regressions

### Challenges Overcome

1. **pyproject.toml Syntax** - Initially placed `[project.urls]` incorrectly; fixed by moving after `[project.scripts]`
2. **Build Validation** - Discovered twine needed separate installation; documented in guide
3. **Test Failures** - Fixed 3 failing tests early in phase for clean baseline

### Recommendations for Future Projects

1. **Start with CI/CD** - Implement automation in Phase 1, not Phase 4
2. **Document as You Go** - Create documentation concurrent with implementation
3. **Validate Early** - Test package building before finalizing metadata
4. **Use Checklists** - Task breakdown in PHASE4_PLAN.md kept work organized
5. **Automate Quality** - Pre-commit hooks catch issues before they reach CI
